This program generates printable text
files of monthly calendars for the month
and year you enter. Dates and calendars are
a tricky topic in programming because there
are so many different rules for determining the number of days in a month, which years are leap years,
and which day of the week a particular date falls on.
Fortunately, Pythonâ€™s datetime module handles these
details for you. This program focuses on generating
the multiline string for the monthly calendar page.
