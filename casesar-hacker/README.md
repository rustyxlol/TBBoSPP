This program can hack messages encrypted
with the Caesar cipher from Project 6, even
if you don’t know the key. There are only 26
possible keys for the Caesar cipher, so a computer can easily try all possible decryptions and display the results to the user. In cryptography, we call
this technique a brute-force attack. If you’d like to learn
more about ciphers and code breaking, you can read
my book Cracking Codes with Python (No Starch Press,
2018; https://nostarch.com/crackingcodes/).
